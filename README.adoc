= Starter Upper

Starter Upper automates set up of git and hosting services so that students and
faculty may use http://db.grinnell.edu/sigcse/sigcse2013/Program/viewAcceptedProposal.pdf?sessionType=paper&sessionNumber=257[git on the cloud in the classroom].
It configures everyone's full name, email, and SSH keys for git and project
hosts, assists in setting up project hosting accounts, and
creates a private repository shared only with the instructor.
For instructors, Starter Upper collects the class roster to fetch student work.
